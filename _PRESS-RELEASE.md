# Represent

## Who speaks for you?

The typical American citizen has dozens of elected representatives, but she probably doesn't know who most of them are. Much less what they say and do.

Represent is the beginning of a new platform, which takes the dull and bureaucratic and serves it stylish and accessible.

Just enter your address at the top of the page and see who speaks for you at the federal, state, county, and municipal levels. Each office identifies the name and contact information of its holder for easy access.

Keep an eye out for updates. We plan to roll out office definitions, campaign contributions, positions on issues, trending news, and district census data.

Knowledge is power, and you have more of it than you know.

Speak. Act. _Represent_.
